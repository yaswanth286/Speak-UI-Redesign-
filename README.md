  ***DESIGN RATIONALE***
  
The primary objective of this website redesign project for the Speak platform was to significantly enhance usability, visual hierarchy, content clarity, and overall user experience. The original homepage, while functional, lacked a coherent structure and engaging visual appeal. Important elements like call-to-action (CTA) buttons, key offerings, and testimonials were either misplaced, not emphasized enough, or missing altogether, which could potentially hinder user engagement and conversion.

To address these issues, the redesigned homepage introduces a structured layout that clearly separates content into digestible sections—hero banner, course highlights, benefits, testimonials, and CTA areas. The hero section now features a bold, high-contrast headline and a prominent CTA button that encourages immediate user action. This not only improves the visual hierarchy but also directs the user's journey more effectively.

Google Fonts were used to improve typography consistency and readability. A refined color palette ensures that the design is not only visually cohesive but also accessible, adhering to contrast best practices. The navigation bar was simplified for clarity and responsiveness across all device sizes using Bootstrap 5's grid and utility classes.

Interactive components such as modals for login, carousels for testimonials, and hover effects for buttons were integrated to modernize the user experience. These elements keep users engaged and make the site feel more dynamic and polished. The inclusion of a responsive design ensures seamless access on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, eliminating the formatting issues observed in the original layout.

The inner page (e.g., Courses or Contact) was also restructured with better spacing, consistent font usage, and a more intuitive layout. Clear contact forms, location information, and support details were prioritized to ensure usability.

Overall, the redesign focuses on improving user flow, encouraging engagement through strategic visual design, and building trust through a professional, clean interface. These changes collectively elevate the Speak brand’s credibility while aligning the site with modern UI/UX standards
